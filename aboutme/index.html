    <h2>Francine Haroldsen</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Francine. I am 23 years old. I have a variety of nicknames such as, Franny, Franci, and Frank. I think Frank is my favorite. I am an illustration major. I am currently working as a Production Artist at an apparel company down in Utah. I LOVE horror movies and Halloween so I'm pumped for this next month. I love to read and to sketch. I am trying to become a self-employed illustrator so I can work from wherever I want. The big dream is to move over to Europe. I am pumped to learn about code as well. I try to expand my hobbies often. If anyone ever has any recommendations for good books or horror movies or even anime, I am here for it. Great to meet you all!</p>
