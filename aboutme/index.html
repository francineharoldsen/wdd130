    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Francine and I am a senior at Brigham Young University-Idaho. I am majoring in Art Illustration and this will actually be my last semester here in Idaho. I am originally from California and I have two brothers and two sisters. The one thing I am most looking forward to after graduating is getting my own pet. I am thinking of either getting a hairless cat or an orange tabby.</p>
    <p>I am definitely going to miss the BYUI campus but I am ready to continue on in my life. I am planning on also traveling around a bit when I graduate. I hope to go to Italy, Spain, or France.</p>
    <p>I am super excited to learn how to code and even with this first assignment I have been having so much fun! Excited to get to know all of you!</p>
