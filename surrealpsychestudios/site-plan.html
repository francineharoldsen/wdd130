      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To exhibit an uncommon style of art that makes the audience look and think in a way they haven't before. I also want to explore more for myself the world of surrealism and how I can create art from within rather than relying on only skill and techniques.  </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is anyone who enjoys or is even a little bit curious of haunting surrealism. Anyone is welcome to see something new and to maybe join a community of peers that have similar aesthetics and taste in art. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        People will come to my website to see new and unique artworks that focus on unusual and appealing surrealism. I want to create another branch of connection between me and the people in this kind of community. I like the idea of providing ideas and artworks that make the audience feel a bit uncomfy or disturbed. But ultimately give them an excuse to peek at the world in a way they haven't before. While I do enjoy horror and spooky stuff, my underlying meanings in my work doesn't have to strictly be scary and dark. I like exposing the hidden beauty of the 'darkness' that I feel like a lot of people do experience. In doing this, it forces me to also acknowledge these feelings and emotions within myself. It opens me to be vulnerable and exposed which I don't usually do. But I don't want to create art for the sake of it looking good in someone's home. I want to include true depth in my pieces that hopefully at least one person can relate and understand. And hopefully it can provide them some comfort knowing that they aren't alone in feeling that way.

      </ul>
      <h3>Products</h3>
      <p>
        I want to eventually have my website be the HQ of my art career. I can have my social media accounts and other things like that to sort of boost up my website. Or to have them be more of the day to day dealings rather than the deeper emotional side of things. I am not sure how to enact that but that is sort of what I am thinking. I dont know if there are any activities to complete, but I am thinking of adding in a store page where they can browse available products and see if they want to purchase any. I would eventually like to have a commission or request area so if I am open to it at the time, I can do custom work for those that like my style. I also would like to put some sort of advice or suggestion so I can see what kind of products or subjects my audience wants to see the most. And to simply just get feedback on how I can improve on any aspect of my business. I would really appreciate that. I know that that could open up some unfair and rude comments but if someone is hating on you, at least you are reaching out to people you know.

      <h3>Sketchbook</h3>
      <p>
        I think that those who visit my personal website will be searching for a deeper look into who I am and the meanings of my work. I would love to include my own interpretations and reasons as to why I make certain works. Especially since people can understand and hopefully make their own personal connections with it. This area will be more focused on the artworks themselves.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        I would want to keep the majority of the aesthetic of the website more modern and not have too much craziness with the content or the colors/text. 
      </p>

      <h3>Product</h3>
      <p>         
        The product wireframe I drew up is what I would like to start with, but I realized that I may have some difficulty actually creating the correct locations or everything. I do believe it will be a great start though.

      <h3>Sketchbook</h3>
      <p>         
        I am not sure about mostly keeping my text content just on the second box, but I was also thinking that I could add in text underneath each image for a title and/or brief description.
