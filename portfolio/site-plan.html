      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My name is Francine Haroldsen and I am practicing my programming techniques. I have a portfolio website that showcases my work with illustration, graphic design and UX design! I can do basic HTML and CSS for any website you can possibly imagine. I truly love being extremely detailed when working in CSS. Wouldn’t it be easier to have someone else do all the tedious work for you? I would be more than happy to help!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I am trying to reach creative directors, artists, illustrators and all people who have a passion for art. I am also hoping to reach those that are capable of mentoring me with illustration or UX design. I hope that this portfolio gives you a glimpse of how much I love art and web design. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi! I am Francine Haroldsen and welcome to my portfolio! I wanted to showcase myself and my work in this site. I thank you for taking time to check my work out! A little bit about me: I am currently an Illustration major at Brigham Young University Idaho. I will be graduating this July and am excited to start the next chapter in my life. I am an avid reader and movie-watcher, specifically horror movies. I have found a new love for web design and learning to code which I would have never thought I would like. I love learning new things! I am currently working on my new knitting skills and hoping to make a little frog soon :D. I have also taken a few book art classes and will be continuing that passion as well! I love art. I love creating. I love the community art and creativity brings. I hope to fill my life with it.

      <h3>Blog</h3>
      <p>
        I dont have a specific style yet but I am leaning toward more of a creepy aesthetic. I hope for this site to attract those who think my work is interesting or enchanting. I hope that I can get my work out there and really be consistent with showing my artwork. I also wanted to focus this assignment on a personal portfolio to organize my work and my hobbies. I want to include more than just art pieces. I want to include journal making, web designs, and just my journey overall. I think I would really like that. I want to be available for commissions or just selling some of my own prints. I think that people would come to my site instead of another’s to see my journey and who I am as an actual person. That is the only true way to connect. To show them that I am just another person.
